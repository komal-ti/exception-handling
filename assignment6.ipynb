    "Ans: Use Multithreading When:  \n",
    "1.  Tasks are I/O-bound (e.g., web scraping).  \n",
    "2. Shared memory is needed.  \n",
    "3. Lightweight and low overhead are important.  \n",

    "Use Multiprocessing When:  \n",
    "1. Tasks are CPU-bound (e.g., data processing).  \n",
    "2. Tasks are independent and don't share memory.  \n",

    "Ques2:Describe what a process pool is and how it helps in managing multiple processes efficiently.\n",
    "Ans: A process pool is a collection of pre-initialized worker processes used to manage and execute tasks efficiently in parallel. It simplifies the creation and management of multiple processes by reusing workers, reducing overhead associated with process creation and destruction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "1. Efficiency: Reuses processes, avoiding the cost of frequently starting and stopping them.\n",
    "2. Task Distribution: Automatically divides tasks among workers, balancing the load.\n",
    "3. Concurrency: Allows multiple tasks to run in parallel across CPU cores.\n",
    "4. Simplified API: Provides functions like `map`, `apply`, and `starmap` for distributing tasks easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is ideal for scenarios like batch processing or CPU-intensive tasks."

    "Ans: Multiprocessing in Python is a module that allows the creation and management of multiple processes to achieve parallelism by leveraging multiple CPU cores. It is used to overcome the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitation in Python, which restricts multithreading for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It Is Used:\n",
    "1. True Parallelism: Executes tasks simultaneously on multiple CPU cores.  \n",
    "2. Bypassing GIL: Allows parallel execution for CPU-bound tasks, which threads cannot achieve in Python.  \n",
    "3. Performance Boost: Speeds up compute-intensive tasks like numerical simulations or data processing.  \n",
    "4. Fault Isolation: Each process runs independently, reducing the risk of one failure affecting others.  "
